Networking:

    Raw socket: it is possible for an application to bypass the transport layer and use IPv4 or IPv6 directly
    XTI

    Sockets provide the interface from the upper three layers of the OSI model into the transport layer:    

    The upper three layers handle all the details of the application. The lower four layers know little about the application, but handle all the communication details
    The upper three layers form what is called a user process while the lower four layers are normally provided as part of the operating system (OS) kerne
